== Description
The Get Variables transform allows you to get the value of a variable and create field(s) from it or allows you to add values to existing input rows. You could consider it to be a "Set fields” transform. It can retrieve the value of a previous variable and/or retrieves previous rows or you can set static values to a variable or input rows. You only need to use this transform if you need the variable value in a field.

|===


Note that workflow/environment variables are set only once. A pipeline needs to start to get any new variables. A running or sequential or nested (nested pipelines are technically the same pipeline) pipeline can't fetch new variable values. A pipeline is considered started when a pipeline starts for every row in a pipeline executor.


Refer to parameter/svariables using the syntax: ${myVariable}, for example from a previous pipeline. If you need to refer to a previous pipeline’s data row(s) fields, then use a Get rows transform.


For example, you can specify: ``${openvar}java.io.tmpdir{closevar}/hop/tempfile.txt`` and it will be expanded to ``/tmp/hop/tempfile.txt`` on Unix-like systems.


You must always specify the data type or you will have errors like the following:

``2023/07/21 09:30:23 - REST client.0 - ERROR: Because of an error, this transform can't continue: 
  2023/07/21 09:30:23 - REST client.0 - TOKEN_URL None : Unknown type 0 specified.
  2023/07/21 09:30:23 - REST client.0 - ERROR: org.apache.hop.core.exception.HopValueException:``

See also the Set Variables transform.
To convert the Variable into a data type other than String use Select Values - Meta Data tab.
To get system values, including command line arguments, use the Get System Info transform.

== Options

[options="header"]
|===
|Option|Description
|transform Name|The name of this transform as it appears in the pipeline workspace.
|Name|Name of the field.
|Variable a|Allows you to enter variables as complete strings to return rows or add values to input rows.
For example, you can specify: ${openvar}java.io.tmpdir{closevar}/hop/tempfile.txt and it will be expanded to /tmp/hop/tempfile.txt on Unix-like systems.

// CTRL-space snippet

|Type|Specifies the field type: String, Date, Number, Boolean, Integer, BigNumber, Serializable, or Binary.
|Format|Allows you to specify the format of the field after the type has been determined.
|Length|For Number: Total number of significant figures in a number; For String: total length of string; For Date: length of printed output of the string (for example, entering 4 would only return the year).
|Precision|For Number: Number of floating point digits.
Not used for String, Date, or Boolean.
|Currency|Used to interpret numbers with currency symbols.
For example, $10,000.00 or E5.000,00.
|Decimal|Used to indicate whether to use a period (".") or comma (",") for number values.
|Group|Used to indicate whether to use a period (".") or comma (",") for number values.
|TrimType|Type trim this field before processing: select either none, left, right, or both (left and right).

== Metadata Injection Support

All fields of this transform support metadata injection.
You can use this transform with ETL Metadata Injection to pass metadata to your pipeline at runtime.
